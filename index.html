        <h3>Impact and Conclusion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>New website deployed in under 2 weeks</li>
          <li>Significant improvement in navigation and mobile usability</li>
          <li>Re-enabled business transactions and class signups directly through the site</li>
          <li>Increased brand presence through a cleaner, more professional web presence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project demonstrated my ability to rapidly build and deploy a modern, production-ready website under tight business constraints. By combining my technical skills in React, Vite, Drizzle ORM, and Tailwind with practical problem-solving and communication with non-technical stakeholders, I delivered a solution that met real business needs.
          It also marked my first time working with third-party tooling like WellnessLiving and using AI pair programming via Replit Agent, giving me experience in adapting to new tools and ecosystems quickly.</p>

        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>Organizing robotics tournaments at scale often involved fragmented tools (Google Sheets, manual score tracking, paper brackets). USEL needed a centralized platform to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Allow users to create and manage tournaments across multiple game modes</li>
            <li>Automate team and bracket management</li>
            <li>Support tournament media uploads and updates</li>
            <li>Be intuitive enough for non-technical users (e.g., coaches, teachers)</li>
          </ul>
